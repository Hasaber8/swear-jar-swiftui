# Swear Jar App - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

The Swear Jar App is a behavioral modification tool designed to help users track, understand, and ultimately reduce their use of profanity. Unlike traditional swear jars, this digital version incorporates emotional intelligence features that help users identify triggers, track moods, and reflect on their language choices. The app supports multiple user profiles, offers detailed analytics, and provides actionable insights to improve self-awareness and encourage positive language habits.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle with controlling profanity use in professional and personal settings. Traditional methods like physical swear jars lack context, personalization, and fail to address the emotional triggers that lead to swearing. Current digital solutions focus only on counting occurrences without providing meaningful insights or supporting behavioral change in a supportive, non-judgmental manner.

## 3. Target Users

**Primary Users:**
- Individuals seeking to reduce profanity in professional or personal settings
- Parents modeling better language habits for children
- Teams creating accountability systems for workplace communication
- People interested in understanding emotional triggers behind language choices

**Demographics:**
- Age: 18-45 years old
- Tech-savvy individuals who value self-improvement and emotional intelligence
- Professionals in environments where language control is important (teachers, customer service, public-facing roles)

## 4. Market Analysis

**Competitor Analysis:**

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| SwearBlock | Simple counter interface, basic blocking functionality | No emotional tracking, limited personalization, punitive approach |
| Language Monitor Pro | Comprehensive word tracking, integration with productivity tools | No emotional context tracking, clinical interface, lacks personalization |
| HabitBreaker | Good habit-building framework, streak tracking | Not language-specific, limited emotional insight capabilities |

**Market Opportunity:**
A gap exists for a solution that combines language tracking with emotional intelligence, creating a tool that addresses not just what users say but why they say it.
